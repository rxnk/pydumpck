pydumpck has transitioned to python 3. Due to the small size of the team behind it,
we can't reasonably maintain compatibility between both python 2 and python 3.
If you want to continue using the most recent version of pydumpck (you definitely
want that, trust us) you should upgrade to python 3. 

For more information, see here: https://github.com/serfend/pydumpck

Good luck!
